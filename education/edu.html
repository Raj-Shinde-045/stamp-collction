            <h2>The World of Stamps</h2>
            <p>Stamps are small, adhesive pieces of paper used to show that postage has been paid for mail services. But they're much more than just a means of payment - they're miniature works of art, historical documents, and windows into different cultures and time periods.</p>

            <h2>Stamps as an Investment</h2>
            <p>While primarily collected for enjoyment, some rare stamps can be valuable investments. Factors affecting a stamp's value include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Rarity and condition</li>
                <li>Historical significance</li>
                <li>Age and printing errors</li>
                <li>Demand among collectors</li>
            </ul>
            <p>However, like any investment, stamp collecting for profit requires knowledge, patience, and careful research.</p>
